The remote repository for the Battle Ship Turing Paired Project. 

Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you wouldâ€™ve approached the design and problem solving process.
We tried writing the tests that were most applicable and easy to conceptualize. Everything that required user input we just slowly peiced together by first writing fragmented methods and then putting them together in a cohesive method to run everything. 


If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?
Debugging and refactoring everything, especially all the content in game.rb and everything that came with iteration 3. 

Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.
We mostly did paired coding, though there were occasions where we did async work. 

Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.
We used comments on PR's through Git Hub, and believe it or not, we mostly did verbal one on one feedback. Worked well.
